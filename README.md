Udacity provided the engine and the goal of the project was
to use JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features to design classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects.

## Object Oriented programming
I think the best way to learn is with visual feedback and that is what this project was designed to do. I had to write code to get everything on blank browser window to render and function like a game.

## Inspiration
I finished this project feeling very inspired to create a game on my own in future project. Perhaps as I'll customize the image assets to create something unique.

### Skill
- Object Oriented programming with Javascript
