# Frogger clone
Udacity provided the engine and the goal of the project was
to use JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features to design classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects.

### How to run this applicaiton
#### Download repository
In terminal run `git clone https://github.com/johnkmeas/frontend-arcade-game.git`

#### Run in browser
- Open index.html in browser
- Use the arrow keys to move the character.
- Try to move character across the road into water.
- When the goal is reached or character collides with enemies, the game will restart.

## Object Oriented programming
I think the best way to learn is with visual feedback and that is what this project was designed to do. I had to write code to get everything in a blank browser window to render and function like a game.

## Inspiration
I finished this project feeling very inspired to develop a puzzle game or a 2d side scrolling game with animated sprites. To start, perhaps I'll customize the image assets in this project to create something unique.

### Skill
- Object Oriented programming with Javascript
